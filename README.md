## Hi there 👋

I’m **Karthik**, a software engineer from India.

I like building things that jump out of my head and straight into code.  
If an idea lands in my brain, chances are I’ll build it, test it, ship it, break it, fix it… and ship it again.

### ⚡ What I Do
- Build frontends that feel smooth and snappy  
- Craft full-stack apps from scratch  
- Experiment with whatever tech seems fun that day  

### 🛠️ Tech I Use
**Frontend:** React, Tailwind, CSS, Bootstrap  
**Backend:** Node.js, Express  
**Tools:** Figma, Notion  

### 🚀 What I Believe  
If I can imagine it, I can build it.  
If I can build it, I’ll ship it.
